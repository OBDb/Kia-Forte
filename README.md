## Generations

The Kia Forte has gone through three distinct generations since its introduction in 2008, each bringing significant improvements in design, technology, and performance:

- **First Generation (2010-2013)**: Introduced as a replacement for the Kia Spectra, the first-generation Forte featured Kia's new Tiger Nose design language created by Peter Schreyer. Available in sedan, coupe (Forte Koup), and hatchback (Forte5) body styles, it came with naturally aspirated four-cylinder engines including a 2.0L producing 158 hp and a 2.4L producing 173 hp. Transmission options included five-speed and six-speed manual gearboxes, as well as four-speed and five-speed automatic transmissions. The first generation established the Forte as a value-oriented compact car with generous standard features.

- **Second Generation (2014-2018)**: Completely redesigned with a lower, wider, and longer stance, the second generation featured LED headlights and taillights as standard equipment. Engine options included a 1.8L four-cylinder producing 148 hp, a 2.0L GDI four-cylinder with 173 hp, and a turbocharged 1.6L four-cylinder generating 201 hp. Available in sedan, coupe, and hatchback configurations, this generation introduced improved interior materials, advanced infotainment systems, and enhanced safety features. A mid-cycle refresh in 2017 updated styling and replaced the 1.8L engine with an Atkinson-cycle 2.0L unit producing 147 hp.

- **Third Generation (2019-2024)**: Launched with styling inspired by the Kia Stinger, the third generation was initially available only as a sedan. The design featured sharper lines, a more athletic stance, and modern interior elements including floating touchscreen displays. Standard equipment included a 2.0L Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder engine producing 147 hp paired with either a six-speed manual or CVT transmission. The turbocharged 1.6L engine returned in 2020, offering 201 hp with either a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. This generation received a facelift for the 2022 model year with updated styling, improved technology features, and enhanced safety systems. Production ended in 2024 as the Forte was replaced by the all-new K4.
