  - name: "First Generation (TD)"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2012
    description: "The original Kia Forte (sold as the Cerato in many international markets) was introduced as a replacement for the Spectra in North America, representing a significant step forward in design, quality, and market positioning. Developed under the direction of Peter Schreyer, it featured more dynamic styling with the emerging 'tiger nose' grille. Available in sedan, five-door hatchback (Forte5), and two-door coupe (Koup) body styles, it offered versatility for different buyer preferences. Powertrain options typically included 1.6L and 2.0L four-cylinder engines, with the latter offering a more powerful SX variant in some body styles. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and features compared to the Spectra, offering amenities like Bluetooth connectivity, satellite radio, and improved safety equipment. This generation established the Forte as a more competitive entry in the compact car segment, helping to transform Kia's image from a purely budget brand to a more mainstream competitor."

    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The second-generation Forte featured more sophisticated styling with a sleeker profile and more distinctive interpretation of Kia's 'tiger nose' grille. Continuing with sedan, hatchback, and coupe body styles, it offered broad appeal across different customer preferences. Built on an updated platform with increased use of high-strength steel, it offered improved structural rigidity, safety, and handling. Engine options typically included 1.8L and 2.0L four-cylinders with direct injection technology in higher trims, paired with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions. The performance-oriented SX models featured a 1.6L turbocharged engine in hatchback and coupe variants. The interior offered a more premium feel with better materials, design, and technology, including available features like a touchscreen infotainment system, cooled glove box, heated and ventilated seats, and advanced safety systems. This generation further established the Forte as a serious competitor in the compact car segment, offering a compelling combination of style, features, and value."

  - name: "Third Generation (BD)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: 2024
    description: "The third-generation Forte was unveiled on January 15, 2018, and features more mature styling with clean lines, a fastback-inspired profile in the sedan, and sophisticated detailing. Available primarily in sedan and five-door hatchback body styles, with the coupe variant discontinued. Built on Kia's platform shared with the Ceed, it offers improved driving dynamics, refinement, and safety. Engine options in North America include a standard 2.0L four-cylinder and a 1.6L turbocharged unit in the GT performance model, paired with manual, conventional automatic, continuously variable transmissions, and dual-clutch transmissions depending on configuration. The interior represents a major step forward with a more premium design, higher quality materials, and advanced technology including an available 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster, and comprehensive connectivity features. Safety technology has advanced significantly with features like forward collision avoidance, lane keeping assist, and driver attention warning. A refresh for the 2021 model year (marketed as 2022 in some regions) updated the styling with revised front and rear fascias and enhanced technology features. Production ended in 2024 as the Forte was succeeded by the Kia K4, marking Kia's realignment of their passenger car nomenclature with the K3 name transferred to a subcompact car segment."
